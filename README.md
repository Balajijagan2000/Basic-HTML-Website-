# Basic-HTML-Website-
Inspired from: <a href="https://www.basicwebsiteexample.com/">https://www.basicwebsiteexample.com/</a>

It is a clone of the "Basicwebsiteexample.com" and done using HTML and CSS.

It is intended to work well on large screens like PC,laptops etc..

It may not work on smartphone screens because the css flexibility and media rule is not used.
